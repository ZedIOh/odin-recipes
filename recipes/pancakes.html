    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        Homemade pancakes are a treat, but they are surprisingly simple to whip up.
        Our easy pancake recipe uses ingredients you likely have on hand, like all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, butter, and egg. 
        Start with our basic recipe, or try one of our variations using buttermilk or yogurt. Either way, you'll have a fluffy stack ready to eat in less than half an hour.
        Tip: Be sure to preheat the oven to keep the pancakes warm while you cook the restâ€”it makes all the difference.</p>
