    <p>With over 4,000 5-star reviews, this classic French beef stew is the all-time most popular recipe on my website. 
    It is the ultimate cold weather comfort food. 
    Chunks of well-marbled beef are seared in a hot pan, then gently braised with garlic and onions in a rich wine-based broth. 
    After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a deeply flavorful sauce. 
    It takes a few hours to make, but the recipe is mostly hands-off. 
    Go ahead and make it a day or two ahead of time; the flavor improves the longer it sits.</p>
